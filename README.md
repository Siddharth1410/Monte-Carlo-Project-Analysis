# Monte-Carlo-Project-Analysis
## Problem Statement
We have a project that consists of four tasks (A, B, C and D) that must be performed
sequentially. The number of days required for each task can vary. Use Monte Carlo simulation
to estimate the total number of days to complete the entire project based upon the table of
days required for each task.</br></br>

Task A | Task B | Task C | Task D
--- | --- | --- | ---
days to complete      prob | days to complete      prob |days to complete      prob |days to complete      prob

4         20% | 2   50% | 8     20% | 5        10%
2         10% |         | 5     20% | 3        5%
